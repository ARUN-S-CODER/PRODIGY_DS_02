DATA CLEANING AND IDENTIFING THE PATERNS AND TRENDS IN THE DATA.

step1: Using pandas module, I read the sample dataset which is the data of train passanger report.
step2: I clean the null values in the dataset using dropna, fillna, median, bfill functions in pandas module.
step3: Using matplotlib I created a line chart based on the Age and the Fare value of the train Ticket From the Dataset.
step4: Using matplotlib I created a bar chart bar chart based on the Sex and the Fare value of the Train Ticket From the Dataset.

Pattern and Trend, From my analysis:
1) The Age group from 35 to 45 are spending huge for the  train fare.
2) The Males are how using the train and paying Fare than Female.
3) So, From this the male of age category 35 to 45 are the target auidence.
